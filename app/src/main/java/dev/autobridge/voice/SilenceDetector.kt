/**
 * Decides when a listen session is over, from the level of the audio alone.
 *
 * Push-to-talk without the push: the user taps the microphone once and talks, and recording should
 * end shortly after they stop, not on a fixed timer. This is an energy detector rather than a
 * model: it measures each 20 ms frame, learns the room's noise floor from the quietest frames, and
 * calls a frame speech when it stands well above that floor. A car cabin at speed is loud but
 * steady, which is exactly what a floor-relative threshold copes with and an absolute one does not.
 *
 * Pure Kotlin and frame-driven, so it is tested by feeding it synthetic frames.
